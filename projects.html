                    <li>Materiality Project</li>
                    <p class="project">For this project, you will be creating a multimodal artifact or 
                        a series of artifacts that engages with concepts of modality. How does your artifact 
                        feature, or obscure, its own material? How do its material and its purpose relate to 
                        each other? For example, I am creating this website for the materiality project. 
                        Other ideas include crocheting something, drawing something, making a zine, 
                        making a comic, sculpting something, etc.</p>
                    <li>Performance Project</li>
                    <p class="project">This project focuses on performance. Will your project move through time alone, 
                        or through time and space? How might you use sound, gesture, light, language, and
                        interaction to create meaning?</p>
                    <li>Transformation Project</li>
                    <p>This project is for those who want a B+ or higher and you will create a transmediated artifact 
                        based on your materiality or performance project. How will you transform one of your previous projects
                        into an antirely new concept? What variables might you explore with media, mode, and means?
                        This project should move among and between, engaging, with course themes. </p>
                    <li>Genre Analysis Essay(s)</li>
                    <p>The genre analysis essay(s) are only for those want an A- or higher. You will be writing one or two 4-5 page 
                        artifact essays, visual essays with 1000-1500 words, or 8-10 minute video essays. These essays will connect 
                        an artifact which represents a genre from the course to conepts from readings and lecture.
