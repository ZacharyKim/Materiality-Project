                <h1>About the Course</h1>
                <p> Course Description: The ability to communicate effectively in multiple types of 
                    media is a crucial part of literacy in our society. In this course, students will 
                    explore the intersections of various media: print, film, images, sound, etc. 
                    Students will consider the ways in which writing--as an object and as 
                    a practice--is shaped by multimodal interactions. Also integrates 
                    practical activities with broader theoretical issues in order to provide 
                    effective strategies for designing multimedia presentations, projects, and 
                    texts that integrate photography, video, and sound.</p>

                <p>This course satisfies the General Education Criteria for Advanced Composition</p>

                <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
                <p>WAM is graded in a unique way where you get to choose the grade you want. You won't be 
                    graded on your technical skill. This course is what you make of it and you get to choose 
                    your grade. This class will be graded using something called Contract Grading: 
                    you will choose what assignments to complete and for what grade to complete them at.
                    For every major project you will need to complete a 3-5 page or a visual essay with 
                    1000-1800 words or a 6-10 minute video (depending on your contract) Rationale 
                    where you explain your design elements and why your project meets the requirements of 
                    the grade you chose. The contract options range from an A+ to a B. </p>
